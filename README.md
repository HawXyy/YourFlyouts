## About

**YourFlyouts** provides multiple replacements for the default Audio/Media/Brightness/Flight flyouts in Windows which are shown while pressing the volume/multimedia/brightness/flight keys.
Along with a number of unique designs, it also provides additional customizability towards the behavioral **and** appearance side of things!

This project is heavily inspired by [ModernFlyouts](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts)!
> Note: Built-in flyout will not be permanently affected. It will be hidden temporarily while YourFlyouts is running, hence it does not modify any system files.
> You can also use YourFlyouts to disable the flyout completely!
